Procedures for processing MARC files for ACO:

-  (Once Only) Set up clone of git repository for "aco-karms" on local computer:  git clone https://github.com/NYULibraries/aco-karms.git

-  For a NEW batch of Columbia, Cornell, or Princeton records:
    1)  Create a new branch on local git clone using command:  git checkout -b [BATCH NAME]  --> git checkout -b NNC_20170109
    2)  Navigate to the "bin" folder:  cd bin
    3)  View the files in bin:  ls
    4)  Run Python script to process xml and OCLC numbers:  python aco-1-xml2mrc-oclc-nums.py
    5)  Run Python script to check and convert records based on original partner's records:  python aco-3-process.py
    6)  Rename new folder of processed records in the batch folder, adding suffix "_on_orig_recs" (e.g., NNC_20170109_3_on_orig_recs)
    7)  Manually export OCLC records from Connexion for those print records containing an OCLC number (see file: aco-2-export-oclc-recs-MANUAL.docx)
    8)  Name the file of OCLC records using this pattern:  [BATCH NAME]_2_oclc_recs_batch.mrc  --> NNC_20170109_3_oclc_recs_batch.mrc
    9)  Place file of OCLC records into batch folder
    10) Re-Run Python script to check and convert records based on OCLC records:  python aco-3-process.py
    11) Review the errors files found in the folder: [BATCH NAME]_3  --> NNC_20170109/NNC_20170109_3
        -  Check the file named "[BATCH NAME]_3_all_recs_analysis.txt" to see how many records were logged with errors
        -  Copy the 2 files named "[BATCH NAME]_3_errors_all.mrc" and "[BATCH NAME]_3_errors_all.txt" onto Box so Adham can retrieve them for QC
    12) Assign the Jira ticket to Adham with a message similar to this:
        -  Adham, This new batch has been processed - Columbia-12 (NNC_20170109) - and is ready for your 1st round of QC.
           There are 37 records in the errors file, which have been copied to Box.  Please let me know if you've any questions or problems.
           Thanks!
           
           For everyone, here are the stats for this 1st round of QC:

           Records containing RDA fields: 48 (100.0%)
           Records with NO 050 or 090 call number fields: 8 (16.7%)
    13) Navigate to the top folder of the git repo:  cd ..
    14) Update github with feature branch and changes on clone:
        -  git status                                        // to check which files have been changed on branch
        -  git add work/[INST CODE]/[BRANCH NAME]*           // to add the files to be committed (e.g., git add work/NNC/NNC_20170109*)
        -  git commit -am 'Process new - Columbia-12 - NNC_20170109 - DLTSACO-464'      // to commit the changed/added files
        -  git push origin [FEATURE BRANCH NAME]            // to push the committed files to github (e.g., git push origin NNC_20170109)
        -  Go to the aco-karms repo on github.com and process the pull request, then delete the feature branch on github.com
        -  Move to the master branch on your local clone:  git checkout master
        -  Update the master branch on your local clone:  git fetch     THEN    git pull origin master
        -  View branches on local clone:  git branch
        -  Delete the feature branch on local clone:  git branch -d NNC_20170109
    15) Update the batch queue table - change "Cataloging Status" column to "QC1-37r" (i.e., noting the number of records in the errors file) and the "Owner" column to "AA" for Adham Alok

-  For a NEW batch of AUB or NYU records:
    -  The only difference is you do NOT retrieve the OCLC records and the processing is solely based on the original partner's records
    -  i.e., SKIP steps 6-10
    
-  Once Adham has finished his QC, he will place his updates file onto the Box drive
