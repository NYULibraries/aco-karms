Procedures for processing MARC files for ACO:

-  (Once Only) Set up clone of git repository for "aco-karms" on local computer:  git clone https://github.com/NYULibraries/aco-karms.git

-  NOTE: All python scripts are very dependent on correct filenames and batch names

-  Processing NEW batches:
    1)  Update the master branch on your local git repo clone using commands:
    			git fetch     THEN    git pull origin master
    			
    2)  Create a new branch on your local git repo clone using command:
    			git checkout -b [BATCH NAME]		
    	For example:
    			git checkout -b NNC_20170109
    			
    3)  Navigate to the "bin" folder:  cd bin
    4)  View the files in bin:  ls
    
    5)  Run the Python script to process xml and OCLC numbers:
    		python aco-1-xml2mrc-oclc-nums.py
        -  Enter the institutional code:
            AUB = LeBAU
            Cornell = NIC
            Columbia = NNC
            New York Univ = NNU
            Princeton = NjP
         -  Enter the batch date in the form YYYYMMDD
         -  This script generates the folder with the suffix "_1"
        
    6)  For Columbia, Cornell, or Princeton records ONLY - Process the OCLC numbers using MarcEdit's OCLC Record Downloader to download the corresponding OCLC records (must enter the API settings for NYU's account)
    	- Open MarcEdit and navigate to the OCLC Record Downloader
    	- For the source file of OCLC numbers, choose the file generated from the previous step named "[BATCH NAME]_1_oclc_nums_for_export.txt"  --> NNC_20170109_1_oclc_nums_for_export.txt
    	- Enter the name of the save file using this pattern:  [BATCH NAME]_2_oclc_recs_batch.mrc  --> NNC_20170109_3_oclc_recs_batch.mrc
    	- Place file of OCLC records into the parent batch folder
    	
    7) Run the Python script to check and convert records based on OCLC records:
    		python aco-3-process.py
    		
    8) Review the errors files found in the folder: [BATCH NAME]_3  --> NNC_20170109/NNC_20170109_3
        -  Check the file named "[BATCH NAME]_3_all_recs_analysis.txt" to see how many records were logged with errors
        -  Copy the 2 files named "[BATCH NAME]_3_errors_all.mrc" and "[BATCH NAME]_3_errors_all.txt" onto Box so Adham can retrieve them for QC
        
    9) Assign the Jira ticket to Adham with a message similar to this:
        -  Adham, This new batch has been processed - Columbia-12 (NNC_20170109) - and is ready for your 1st round of QC.
           There are 37 records in the errors file, which have been copied to Box.  Please let me know if you've any questions or problems.
           Thanks!
           
           For everyone, here are the stats for this 1st round of QC:
           ----------------------------------------------------------
           Total records processed - batch NNC_20170109: 48 records
           Report produced: 2017-01-17 14:04:13.376957
           Input File (oclc_batch): 48
           Input File (orig_no_oclc): 0
           
           Records where OCLC nums did not match: 0
           Total records containing any type of error for this round: 37 (77.1%)
           Total records passing to final version for this round: 11 (22.9%)
           -----------------------
           Records containing 880 script fields: 27 (56.3%)
           Records with NO 880 script fields: 21 (43.8%)
           Records missing key 880 script fields: 15 (31.3%)
           Records containing unlinked 880 script fields: 10 (20.8%)
           Records containing series errors in 490/800/810/811/830 fields: 0 (0.0%)
           Records containing miscellaneous errors: 8 (16.7%)
           Records containing bad encoding replacement character: 0
           Records containing RDA fields: 48 (100.0%)
           Records with NO 050 or 090 call number fields: 8 (16.7%)
           
    10) Navigate to the top folder of the git repo:  cd ..
    
    11) Update github with feature branch and changes on clone:
        -  git status                                        // to check which files have been changed on branch
        -  git add work/[INST CODE]/[BRANCH NAME]*           // to add the files to be committed (e.g., git add work/NNC/NNC_20170109*)
        -  git commit -am 'Process new - Columbia-12 - NNC_20170109 - DLTSACO-464'      // to commit the changed/added files
        -  git push origin [FEATURE BRANCH NAME]            // to push the committed files to github (e.g., git push origin NNC_20170109)
        -  Go to the aco-karms repo on github.com and process the pull request, then delete the feature branch on github.com
        -  Move to the master branch on your local clone:  git checkout master
        -  Update the master branch on your local clone:  git fetch     THEN    git pull origin master
        -  View branches on local clone:  git branch
        -  Delete the feature branch on local clone:  git branch -d NNC_20170109
        
    12) Update the batch queue table - change "Cataloging Status" column to "QC1-37r" (i.e., noting the number of records in the errors file) and the "Owner" column to "AA" for Adham Alok

    
-  Once Adham has finished his QC, he will place his updates file onto the Box drive at: BoxSync/ACO-QC-Files

-  Processing QC UPDATES:
	1) Retrieve the updates file from the shared ACO folder on the Box drive: BoxSync/ACO-QC-Files - it should be named in the pattern "[BATCH NAME]_3_updates.mrc"  -->  NNC_20170109_3_updates.mrc
	2) Copy the updates file into the folder in the batch that has the suffix "_3"
	3) Repeat Steps 1-4 above, Skip Steps 5-6, and Repeat Steps 7-12
    4) In Step 8, if there are NO more valid errors that need to be fixed, assign the Jira ticket to Joe P. letting him know that the QC process is complete and he can start on the next steps of publishing
	5) In Step 11 you will add "- FINAL SET" to the end of the git commit message
	6) In the queue table, set the Cataloging Status to "Done" and change the Owner to "N/A"
